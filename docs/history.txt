Artificial Economic Life : a Simple Model of a Stockmarket
	R.G. Palmer, W. Brian Arthur, John H. Holland,
	Blake LeBaron, Paul Tayler Dec 98

	Using simple established economic models for determining stock
	value based on supply/demand, evolved agents who buy/sell their
	stocks based on varioud constraints specified by a string.
	These strings are bred, descisions made based on stock market
	state string (genotype is schema (0,1,*) mask for this state
	string).

	Stock market modeling emerged, did not equilize (chaotic) and exhibited
	all major features of markets in 'real' world.
